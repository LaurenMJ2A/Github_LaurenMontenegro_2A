'O steed, (my) stalwart companion
I mourn your loss
Even in death, (you were the) first in battle,
(And the) last to retreat, even so in death
Alas, I have lost a part of myself.
Long live the king
May his reign last forever
May his strength...
Fail him never.
'O steed, (my) stalwart companion
I mourn your loss
Even in death, (you were the) first in battle,
(And the) last to retreat, even so in death
Alas, I have lost a part of myself.
